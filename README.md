## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Sass
- Gulp
- Npm

### What I learned

In this project i've learned how to use npm on how to install like gulp , sass , autoprefixer and browser-sync 

### Continued development

I think i need to learn parcel substitute for gulp for less configuration and i will continue to use flexbox for my next project until i get comfortable to use it.
